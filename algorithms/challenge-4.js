// Given an amount between 40 and 10000 Naira (inclusive) rounded to the nearest 10 and assuming that the ATM wants to use as few bills as possible.

// Implement the function withdraw(amount) that returns the minimal number of 100, 50 and 20 Naira bills the ATM needs to dispense (in that order) in an array.

// ## Examples

// withdraw(250) to return [2,1,0]  
// withdraw(370) to return [3,1,1]
